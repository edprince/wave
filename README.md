blogging platform

In an attempt to re-energize this repo, I will start working on this alongside other projects. Before I get into the platform details, I would like to point out, this is not a project that I am looking to be unique, or successful, just to see if I can do it. 

And swiftly moving on...

Wave will incorporate the absolute simplicity of blogging. A backend database will store the data about each post, and PHP will handle the rest.

#Project Tree
##Front End

A html/php page that can display the posts made by the user.

##Backend

MySQL database that stores:
 - ID
 - Post Author
 - Post Date
 - Post Summary
 - Post Title
 - Post Content
 
A php page for connecting to the database and serving out data.
